When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

whenever we're working on a project collaboratively then it is necessary to sync all the code in the remote repository so whenever a new 
team member wants to get latest code he would be able to get one from the remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The reason of any pull is to add some extra feature in it. and sometimes that feature required editors, compilers for coding that are not provided on git remote repository.
for testing purpose.
